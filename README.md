(a) Elasticity and Scalability in Cloud Computing for Deep Learning (10 points)
•	Elasticity refers to the ability of a cloud computing system to dynamically allocate and deallocate resources based on the workload demands. In deep learning, elasticity ensures that resources (such as GPUs, TPUs, and memory) are adjusted in real-time to optimize performance and cost efficiency. This is particularly useful when training large models that require variable computing power at different stages.
•	Scalability is the capability of a cloud system to handle increasing workloads by either upgrading existing resources (vertical scaling) or adding more computing nodes (horizontal scaling). For deep learning, scalability enables seamless expansion of training and inference infrastructure, allowing models to process larger datasets and execute more complex computations efficiently.
